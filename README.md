# CSV reader

This is a program that reads data from a given JSON file, sorts the data according to the user's selection, and outputs it in the CSV file format.

The character code is UTF-8.
The language used is Kotlin.
No external library is used.

I created and added a so-called fatjar file that includes external libraries.
You can check the operation by putting the CsvDataSortInKotlin-all.jar file and the UTF8Test.csv file in the same folder.
